If you're ready, I can now prepare a .docx project file with all the above content properly formatted and share it with you. Want that?

No, I want all these doc in real format of them seperately. And diagrams and matrices also . Write them step by step as it will written in real software project by some industry

Created document
All right! I’ve created the full structured documentation for your Deepfake Detection project in a proper industry-style format. It includes all documents (SRS, DDS, testing, deployment, etc.), diagrams (described in standard formats), and matrices — all aligned with a 2-month project timeline.

You can now view, edit, or export this documentation directly in the panel on the side. If you’d like, I can now help you:

Generate visual diagrams (like Use Case, DFDs, ER diagrams)

Export this as a downloadable DOCX or PDF

Add team roles, references, or extra technical details

What would you like to do next?

Add team roles line
ChatGPT said:
Here’s how you can add the “Team Roles” section to your Deepfake Detection project documentation in an industry-standard format. This section typically appears near the start of the document, after the title and abstract/introduction.

📌 Team Roles (Sample Format for Your Project)

Team Roles and Responsibilities

Name	Role	Responsibilities
Alice Sharma	Project Manager	Oversee project phases, timeline management, communication with stakeholders.
Ravi Mehta	Lead Developer (ML/Python)	Develop and optimize MesoNet model, preprocessing, and integration.
Priya Kapoor	Web Developer (Flask/PHP)	Create UI for upload, response page, backend connection to model.
Anil Joshi	Database Engineer	Design and implement database schema, manage data flow and storage.
Swati Roy	Tester & QA Engineer	Write and execute test cases, maintain bug logs and performance metrics.
Shreya Sinha	Documentation Specialist	Prepare all documentation, diagrams, matrices, and user manuals.
If you’re working solo, you can collapse these into one or two roles — just adjust accordingly.

Would you like me to now place this team section into each relevant document (like SRS, DDS, etc.) or just once in a “Team” section at the beginning of the project bundle? Also, want to use real team member names or placeholders like above?
