## Overview

This document serves as a guide to all documentation created for the Deepfake Detection System project. It provides a summary of each document and its purpose within the software engineering process.

## Documentation Structure

### 1. Requirements and Specifications

| Document | Description | Location |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** | Defines functional and non-functional requirements | [docs/SRS.md](SRS.md) |
| **User Manual** | End-user guide for system operation | [docs/User_Manual.md](User_Manual.md) |

### 2. Design and Architecture

| Document | Description | Location |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Detailed Design Architecture (DDA)** | Detailed system design and component specifications | [docs/DDA.md](DDA.md) |
| **Class Diagram** | UML representation of system classes and relationships | [docs/diagrams/ClassDiagram.md](diagrams/ClassDiagram.md) |
| **Data Flow Diagram** | Visual representation of data flows in the system | [docs/diagrams/DataFlowDiagram.md](diagrams/DataFlowDiagram.md) |
| **Entity Relationship Diagram** | Database schema and entity relationships | [docs/diagrams/EntityRelationshipDiagram.md](diagrams/EntityRelationshipDiagram.md) |
| **Sequence Diagram** | Time-ordered interaction between components | [docs/diagrams/SequenceDiagram.md](diagrams/SequenceDiagram.md) |
| **State Transition Diagram** | System states and transitions | [docs/diagrams/StateTransitionDiagram.md](diagrams/StateTransitionDiagram.md) |
| **Use Case Diagram** | UML representation of system use cases | [docs/diagrams/UseCase.md](diagrams/UseCase.md) |

### 3. Project Management

| Document | Description | Location |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Project Metrics** | Quantitative project measurements and analysis | [docs/Project_Metrics.md](Project_Metrics.md) |
| **Test Plan** | Comprehensive testing strategy and test cases | [docs/Test_Plan.md](Test_Plan.md) |
| **Deployment Document** | Deployment process and environment specifications | [docs/Deployment.md](Deployment.md) |

## Document Relationships

The documentation follows standard software engineering relationships:

1. **SRS** forms the foundation for all other documents
2. **DDA** implements the requirements specified in the SRS
3. **Diagrams** visualize different aspects of the system design
4. **Test Plan** verifies that the implementation meets the requirements
5. **Project Metrics** measures the development process and product quality
6. **Deployment Document** specifies how to deploy the system
7. **User Manual** provides end-user guidance for the completed system

## Using This Documentation

### For Developers
- Start with the **SRS** to understand requirements
- Review the **DDA** for implementation details
- Consult the **Diagrams** for visual representation of system components
- Follow the **Test Plan** for verification
- Use the **Deployment Document** for system deployment

### For Project Managers
- Use the **SRS** to track requirement implementation
- Reference the **Project Metrics** for performance tracking
- Review the **Test Plan** for quality assurance progress

### For End Users
- Refer to the **User Manual** for system operation guidance

## Documentation Standards

All documentation follows these standards:
- Markdown format for easy versioning and readability
- Consistent structure and terminology
- Cross-referenced between related documents
- Version controlled in the project repository
- Diagrams in text-based format for version control compatibility

## Document Maintenance

Documentation should be updated:
- When requirements change
- When design decisions are modified
- When implementation deviates from design
- When new features are added
- At the end of each development phase

## Document Approvals

Each document should be reviewed and approved by:
1. Project Manager
2. Development Lead
3. QA Lead
4. Subject Matter Expert (where applicable)

## Document Versioning

Documents follow the same versioning scheme as the software:
- Major version (X.0): Significant changes
- Minor version (X.Y): Feature additions or substantial updates
- Revision (X.Y.Z): Corrections or minor updates
