## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What are Deepfakes?

Deepfakes are synthetic media in which a person's likeness is replaced with someone else's using artificial intelligence techniques. These manipulated images and videos can appear remarkably realistic, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between authentic and fake content.

### 1.2 About the System

The Deepfake Detection System uses MesoNet, a deep learning architecture specifically designed to identify deepfake manipulations in images. This system provides an easy-to-use web interface that allows you to upload images and receive an analysis indicating whether the image contains a real face or a deepfake, along with a confidence score.

### 1.3 System Capabilities

- Detection of deepfake manipulations in face images
- Educational resources about deepfake technology
- Interactive demonstrations of the detection technology
- Knowledge quiz to test your understanding
- Gallery of example deepfakes and real images

## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1 System Requirements

To use the Deepfake Detection System, you need:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge, latest versions recommended)
- Internet connection
- Images containing faces for analysis (JPG, JPEG, or PNG format)

### 2.2 Accessing the System

The Deepfake Detection System is accessible at: [https://deepfake-detection.com](https://deepfake-detection.com)

No login or registration is required to use the system.

## 3. Using the Deepfake Detection Tool

### 3.1 Uploading an Image

1. Navigate to the homepage at [https://deepfake-detection.com](https://deepfake-detection.com)
2. Locate the upload section, which shows a dotted rectangular area
3. Click the "Choose File" button or drag and drop an image into the designated area
4. Select an image from your device that contains a face
5. Click the "Detect Deepfake" button to start the analysis

**Note:** The system accepts JPG, JPEG, and PNG image formats with a maximum size of 16MB.

### 3.2 Understanding the Results

After uploading an image, you will be redirected to the results page, which displays:

1. **The uploaded image:** Your image is shown for reference
2. **Classification result:** Either "Real" or "Fake"
3. **Confidence score:** A percentage indicating how confident the system is in its classification
4. **What this means:** A brief explanation of the result

Example interpretations:
- "Real (95% confidence)" indicates the system is very confident the image contains a real, unmanipulated face
- "Fake (87% confidence)" indicates the system has detected characteristics of a deepfake with good confidence

### 3.3 Recent Detections

The homepage displays recent detection results (without showing the full images) to provide examples of the system's capabilities. These results include:

- Filename (partial)
- Classification result (Real/Fake)
- Confidence score
- Timestamp

This section is updated automatically as new images are processed.

## 5. Troubleshooting

### 5.1 Image Upload Issues

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| "No file selected" error | No image was chosen | Select an image before clicking the "Detect" button |
| "Invalid file type" error | File format not supported | Use only JPG, JPEG, or PNG image formats |
| "File too large" error | Image exceeds size limit | Resize the image to under 16MB |
| "No face detected" warning | No clear face in the image | Upload an image with a clearly visible face |

### 5.2 Detection Issues

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Low confidence score | Ambiguous visual cues | Try a different image with better quality |
| Incorrect classification | Complex deepfake or unusual lighting | Consider the confidence score and use judgment |
| Page takes too long to load | Large image or network issues | Try a smaller image or check your connection |

### 5.3 Browser Compatibility

If you experience display issues:
1. Update your browser to the latest version
2. Clear your browser cache and cookies
3. Try a different browser if problems persist

## 6. Frequently Asked Questions

### 6.1 General Questions

**Q: Is this system 100% accurate?**  
A: No detection system is perfect. Our system achieves over 90% accuracy on benchmark datasets, but results may vary depending on the quality and characteristics of submitted images.

**Q: Does the system store my uploaded images?**  
A: Uploaded images are stored temporarily for processing and are automatically deleted after 24 hours. We maintain logs of detection results without the full images.

**Q: Can I use this system for video analysis?**  
A: Currently, the system only supports image analysis. Video analysis functionality may be added in future versions.

### 6.2 Technical Questions

**Q: What deep learning model does the system use?**  
A: The system uses MesoNet, a convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for deepfake detection. It focuses on the mesoscopic properties of images.

**Q: How does the confidence score work?**  
A: The confidence score represents the probability (0-100%) assigned by the model to its classification decision. Higher scores indicate greater confidence in the result.

**Q: What image resolution works best?**  
A: For optimal results, use images with faces that are clearly visible and at least 256x256 pixels in size.
